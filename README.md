# React Pinterest

My goal for this project was to recreate a previous Pinterest-esque project in **React** as a way to practice state management, CRUD, authentication, and relating data using join tables on **Firebase**.

## Functionality
In this application, a user can: 
- View all public pins
- Create a new pin and set it to public or private
- View all of the user's created pins
- Update and delete pins
- Create boards
- View all of the user's created boards
- Update and delete boards
- Pin a pin to a board
- Search the name and descriptions of both pins and boards
